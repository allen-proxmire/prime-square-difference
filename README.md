# The Prime Triangle and Prime Square-Difference Identity

## Overview

The Prime Square-Difference Identity

\[
(p_{n+2})^{2} = (p_n)^{2} + 12x
\]

gives rise to an integer **PSD Factor** \(x\) with a rigid last-digit pattern \{0,4,6\}.  
The factor admits both:

- a **modular explanation**, and  
- a natural analytic approximation  
  \[
  x \approx \frac{g\,p_n}{6},
  \]
  where \(g = p_{n+2} - p_n\) is the skip-one prime gap.

In the structured case where the skip-one gap is \(6\), the PSD Factor recovers (up to ±1) the middle prime of a twin-prime pair and determines which adjacent prime forms the pair. This combination of algebraic rigidity, modular restriction, and prime-gap structure gives the PSD Factor a rich internal behavior and suggests several directions for further exploration.

# The Prime Triangle and Prime Square-Difference Identity

## Overview
The Prime Square-Difference Identity
(pn+2)2 = (pn)2 + 12x
gives rise to an integer PSD Factor x with a rigid last-digit pattern {0, 4, 6}.
The factor admits both a modular explanation and a natural analytic approximation
x ≈ g pn/6 tied to the magnitude of the skip-one prime gap.
In the highly structured case where the skip-one gap is 6, the PSD Factor
recovers (up to ±1) the middle prime of a twin-prime pair and determines
which adjacent prime forms the pair. This combination of algebraic rigidity,
modular restriction, and prime-gap structure gives the PSD Factor a rich
internal behavior and suggests several directions for further exploration.
